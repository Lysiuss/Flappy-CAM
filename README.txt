Welcome into our Flappy'CAM project !

First, you have to install our project through github (Clone code --> Download .ZIP), and then you have to execute the Flappy'CAM.exe.
During installation, you need to choose the C:\ directory because we have files which are called into our script which will not be found if you put it anywhere else than "C:\".
(We did this to have you do as less things as possible to launch the game)

If you do not want to install it there, you can still run the program by going into the script (main.py) and changing the "path_dir" variable (at the top of the code) to the directory you installed the "Flappy Bird" folder.

Then, you only need to launch it: 
- If you installed it in the C:\ directory, you can directly launch the shortcut "Flappy'CAM" in the "Flappy Bird" folder.
- If you didn't, then you have to launch it directly with your python compiler by opening main.py and launching from there. If you want to restart the game, you need to restart the shell everytime.


We hope you enjoy playing our little game and we wish you a Happy Flapping !


P.S: you will have errors when you quit the game, those are not to be concerned about. Also, if you have problems with the size of the window of the game, we are sorry, we weren't able to fix them as they differ from one computer to another (even computers with the same resolution).
